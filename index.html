                <h3>Here's a time line of Elon Musk's failures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(1995) Netscape application failure:</strong> Despite not having a background in computer science, Musk applied for a job at Netscape and even went to the head office to follow up on his application but was too shy to speak to anyone.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>(1996) Being ousted from Zip2:</strong> Musk founded Zip2 with his brother in the mid-’90s but was ousted as CEO by the board of directors. It was thought he didn’t have the operational skill sets of a CEO, so became Chairman holding onto his shares which made him $22 million.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2000) Musk is pushed out from PayPal:</strong> In April 2000, Musk was made CEO of PayPal and found himself argument over software and operating systems with former CTO, Max Levchin. As a result, he was ousted as CEO whilst on his honeymoon and later went on to say “that’s the problem with taking vacations”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2000) Malaria almost killed Musk:</strong> In the same year as his PayPal ousting, he caught cerebral malaria and it took him more than 6 months to recover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2001) No rockets from Russians:</strong> Awash in cash after selling PayPal, Musk wanted to send something to Mars – perhaps a mouse in a space capsule – to ignite public interest in space exploration. He visited Russia to buy three intercontinental ballistic missiles and they refused to sell after raising the price to $21 million for each rocket.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2002) The Russians called him a "young boy":</strong> Musk was keen to invest in rocket technology and approached the Russians once again, where they turned him down and said: “Young boy, no”. On the flight back, Musk turned to Cantrell and said: “I think we can build a rocket ourselves.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2006) First rocket launch & first explosion:</strong> After years of development and no less than three scrubbed attempts, a solitary Falcon 1 rocket roared toward space only to be lost just after liftoff. This was to happen once again just a year later...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2008) Third rocket explosion with NASA:</strong> Two minutes after launch, the two-stage Falcone 1 rocket became Musk’s third failed rocket launch, but this time, there was NASA satellites on board.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2008) SpaceX & Tesla on the brink of going bankrupt:</strong> It’s quickly becoming the worst year of Musk’s life. His rockets were failing, he was getting divorced and his two companies were on the brink of going bankrupt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2015) Another rocket explodes:</strong> An unmanned American Falcon-9 rocket has broken apart in flames minutes after lifting off from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Debris from the SpaceX vehicle tumbled out of the sky in the Atlantic Ocean.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2016) Tesla Model X is delayed:</strong> Model X deliveries are delayed by more than 18 months and are not expected until June 2018.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2017) The Merlin exploded under testing:</strong> No one was injured, but now the company founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk once again had to figure out what went wrong with its hardware. The setback came as SpaceX was having a record-setting year with 16 launches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(2018) Tesla recalls 123,000 cars:</strong> In March, Tesla voluntarily recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of issues with the power steering components. Shares of Tesla fell nearly 4 percent in after-hours trade.
                    </li>
                </ul>
